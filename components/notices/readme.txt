Sincerity
=========

Sincerity is a tool for installing and bootstrapping software stacks on top of the JVM.
It makes these otherwise tedious tasks easy, simple and fun.

A comprehensive manual is included in this distribution, in the "/reference/manuals/"
directory.

It is also available online, on the Sincerity web site:
